### Example: Project Management for a New Product Launch

**Scenario**: A company is launching a new product and needs to coordinate efforts across multiple departments.

1. **Collaboration**: Team members from marketing, R&D, and sales use a dedicated SharePoint site to co-author project plans, share updates, and discuss tasks using integrated discussion boards and document libraries.
> sharepoint => `+ create site => Team Site`

3. **Enterprise Content Management (ECM)**: All project-related documents, such as research reports, marketing materials, and legal agreements, are stored in a structured manner with metadata for easy access and compliance.

4. **Web Content Management**: A public-facing site is created to promote the new product, featuring blog posts, videos, and product information, which marketing can update easily without needing IT support.
> sharepoint => `+ create site => Communication site`

6. **Social Computing**: Employees can share insights and feedback about the product launch on a dedicated community page, fostering engagement and collaboration across departments.

7. **Search**: Team members utilize SharePoint’s powerful search functionality to quickly locate documents, relevant discussions, and expert contacts related to the product launch.

8. **Business Intelligence (BI)**: The finance team creates dashboards in SharePoint that visualize sales forecasts, budget reports, and KPIs related to the product launch, enabling real-time data-driven decision-making.

10. **Composites**: Custom workflows are built to automate approvals for marketing materials and budget expenditures, streamlining processes and ensuring accountability.

11. **Hybrid**: Sensitive product development documents are kept on-premises for security, while marketing materials and collaboration tools are hosted in SharePoint Online to facilitate remote work.

12. **Mobile Experience**: Sales representatives access the SharePoint mobile app to view the latest product information and marketing materials, allowing them to respond to customer inquiries while in the field.

### Summary:
In this scenario, SharePoint 2016 enables effective collaboration and management of resources across various functionalities, ensuring a successful and well-coordinated product launch.

## Information 
> Information architecture is about how you organize and label your content and how your visitors interact with the content to get work done. Modern SharePoint information architecture is also about how to ensure the right content gets to the right people and follows your organization’s content compliance regulations.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepointonline/media/roles.png) 

Information architecture covers six main elements that relate to way finding in SharePoint:

- Global navigational structure – Considered the top level of navigation across your SharePoint tenant and how you structure your sites so that users can find content including the home site of your intranet.
- Hub structure and organization – Hubs enable you to group together similar topics, tasks, and content.
- Local site and page navigational structure – How content is organized on each site and page so that users can further navigate or consume content effectively.
- Metadata architecture – Metadata impacts search and browsing structure as well as compliance and retention policies.
- Search experiences – How your users "consume" information architecture in addition to browsing.
- Personalized content experiences – How specific content is targeted to certain users and groups of users.

> Classic SharePoint architecture is typically built using a hierarchical system of site collections and subsites, with inherited navigation, permissions, and site designs. Once built, this structure can be inflexible and difficult to maintain. In the modern SharePoint experience, subsites aren't recommended.

- Global navigation for the entire collection of sites that comprise your intranet
- Hub navigation for groups of related sites
- Local navigation of an individual site
